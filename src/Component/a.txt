The scroll progress (ranging from 0 to 1) is divided into six phases:

Phase 1 (0%–20% Scroll)
X-Axis Movement:
The model moves horizontally from a starting position of 0 to a target of 2 (computed as phase1 * 2).

Rotation:
The model rotates from its initial orientation (0 radians) toward π (-30°). This uses a smoothstep function to ensure a smooth transition.

Camera Adjustments:
The camera slightly zooms in: its Z-position decreases (from 4 toward 3.5) and its field-of-view (FOV) narrows (from 60 to 55).

Phase 2 (20%–30% Scroll)
Hold and no Continue Rotation:
Movement: The model’s X-position holds at 2.
Rotation: The rotation stays as it is
Camera:
The camera zooms in a bit
Phase 3 (30%–45% Scroll)
Opposite Side Movement:
The model shifts on the X-axis from 2 to –2.5, moving across to the opposite side.

Rotation Reset:
The model’s rotation transitions from -30 to +30

Camera Shift:
camera stays as it is ,just slightly move on the left like model

Phase 4 (45%–65% Scroll)
Cap Animation:
This phase is dedicated to animating the cap:
The cap’s Y-position moves upward (targeted up to 0.6 units).
The cap rotates around the Y-axis (up to 1.85π radians) using an easing function for smoothness.
If the easing value goes past 0.9, a “return” easing effect gradually brings the cap back, giving a natural motion.
Model and Camera:
The model’s X-position stays at –2.
The overall model rotation holds at a small offset (0.2π) to offer a better view of the cap.
The camera begins moving upward while zooms closer to focus on the cap’s action while looking at the cap
Phase 5 (65%–95% Scroll)
Color Transition:
The scarf’s color transitions in two steps:

First Half (65%–80%): The color shifts from the original color to burgundy using an eased interpolation.
Second Half (80%–95%): The color then transitions from burgundy to sage green.
Model Movement:
During this phase, the model should stay as it is

Rotation and Camera:
The model makes 360 turns for each color change transitions

Phase 6 (95%–100% Scroll)
Final Presentation:
The color then transitions from sage green to original/initial color

X-Axis Movement: position stays as it is
Y-Axis (Vertical) Sequence:
First third: The model scales gradually
Second third: The model scales gradually
Final third: The model scales gradually
Rotation Adjustment:
no rotation needed

Camera Finale:
The camera goes through a three-step sequence:
